private let DefaultRadius = 5.0

/// A circle on the canvas:
///
///   - `radius` The distance from the center of the circle to its outside edge. Must be 0.0 or greater.
///
/// Additional properties that can affect Circle:
///
///   - `color` The color to fill the shape with.
///   - `borderWidth` The border width of the shape. The default value is 2.0.
///   - `borderColor` The color to use for the border of the shape. The default value is the same as the fill color.
///   - `center` The center point of the object. Changing this moves the object.
///   - `scale` The amount to grow or shrink the object. A value of 1.0 is the natural (unscaled) size. A value of 0.5 would be 1/2 the original size, while a value of 2.0 would be twice the original size.
///   - `rotation` The angle in radians to rotate this object. Changing this rotates the object counter clockwise about its center. A value of 0.0 (the default) means no rotation. A value of π (3.14159…) will rotate the object 180°, and 2π will rotate a full 360°.
///   - `draggable` Makes the object draggable with your finger on the canvas. The default value is false.
///   - `shadow` The drop shadow for this object. The default is nil, which results in no shadow. To add a shadow, you can set this property, like this: `myObject.dropShadow = Shadow()`.
